This webpage will be a basic calender, where you can:

- see what day and time it is. 
-see as set number of timeblocks for standard buisness hours
-each time block is color coded to indicate wheter it is in the past, present or future
-you can enter and save an event


The first thing i did was copy the js from moment-js and createa  js file, so that my webpage could use the API's info.
